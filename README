The AsyncTask mechanism in Android provides cancellation semantics but no way to pause and
resume background work. The ThreadControl class shown in this project is precisely meant for
that. It gives a simple way for the main GUI thread to control all background threads. The
main thread can pause, resume and cancel work.
